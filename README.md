# Changelog Component

Create a changelog component for a website using HTML and CSS.

Start building, submit your solution, and get feedback from the community.

In this project, you are required to create a simple component for a website that displays a **changelog**. A changelog is a log or record of all notable changes made to a project or software. It is often used to keep users informed about the latest updates and improvements.

The goal of this project is to teach you about **positioning and layout** in CSS. You will create a simple HTML structure and use CSS to style it into a visually appealing and responsive changelog component. Below is a rough mockup of the changelog component you need to create.

### Changelog Component

Feel free to customize the design and layout of the component as you see fit. The focus should be on creating a **well-structured** and **responsive** component that can be easily integrated into a website.

After completing this project, you will have a good understanding of how to create simple layouts using HTML and CSS. You can further enhance your skills by exploring more complex layouts, such as **grids** and **flexbox**, in future projects.
